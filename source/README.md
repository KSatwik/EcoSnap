Go EcoSnap! Go Green!

The EcoSnap application is a revolutionary platform that rewards users for their positive impact on the environment. 
Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning object detection, the app assigns points based on the eco-friendliness of a 
user's actions. For example, using public transportation rather than a personal vehicle earns a user 5 points. These
points can be redeemed for discounts and other rewards provided by environmentally conscious companies. To maintain the 
integrity of the system, the app also uses an anti-duplication algorithm to detect and prevent the submission of duplicate
images. By promoting and rewarding sustainable behavior, EcoSnap is making it easier and more appealing to be environmentally conscious.
