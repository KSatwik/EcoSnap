This project aims to develop a Social Media platform and application that helps individuals track their carbon footprint, 
while also providing them with suggestions and eco-friendly alternatives (for example, alternative modes of transportation,
energy-efficient appliances and lighting, sustainable food and clothing options, etc). The app is designed like a social media 
platform where users can post their contributions towards reducing their carbon footprints, share with their friends, and earn 
points and badges based on the level of impact, which they can use to redeem as vouchers. Additionally, the app would allow users 
to set goals for reducing it over time. The app would be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a focus on providing 
practical and actionable information. The users can add friends and influence each other with innovative ideas. Overall, the app 
aims to empower individuals and businesses to make a positive impact on the environment by reducing their carbon footprint.
